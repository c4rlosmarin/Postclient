# ![PostClient](PostClient/Assets/SmallIcon.png) PostClient

An Azure oriented application designed to streamline our workflow by providing a user-friendly interface for making REST API calls.

PostClient offers several advantages that I believe will significantly enhance our development process:

**User-Friendly Interface:** PostClient is built with ease of use in mind. Its intuitive design allows team members to quickly understand and navigate the tool, reducing the time needed to make REST API calls. This user-friendly approach means that even those who are less familiar with API interactions can start using PostClient with minimal effort.

**Handy Shortcuts:** The tool includes convenient shortcuts for common request parameters and headers, which will save us time and reduce the potential for errors. These shortcuts are designed to make our work faster and more accurate.

**Enhanced Security with Offline Functionality:** PostClient operates entirely offline, ensuring that no data is ever stored in the cloud. By keeping all data local, we can guarantee the highest level of security and privacy for our projects. This is particularly important for our team as we handle sensitive information and need to maintain strict confidentiality.

**Storage REST API Templates:** PostClient comes with a template of the Storage REST API definitions, allowing users to quickly navigate through and understand the API structure. This feature is particularly useful for those who are new to the Storage REST API.

**In-House Flexibility:** As an in-house project, PostClient offers us the flexibility to prioritize features and improvements that are most important to us. This means that we can tailor the tool to meet our specific needs and ensure that it evolves in a way that benefits our team the most.


# Getting Started with Azure REST APIs

PostClient is particularly beneficial for team members who need to interact with Azure REST APIs. With its user-friendly interface, PostClient simplifies the process of constructing and sending API requests. The built-in templates for Storage REST API definitions provide a quick start for understanding the API structure and available operations. This allows team members to focus on the logic of their interactions rather than the intricacies of API syntax.

**Launch PostClient:** Open the PostClient application from your workstation.

**Explore the Interface:** Take a moment to familiarize yourself with the layout and features. The user-friendly interface is designed to be intuitive, so you should find it easy to navigate.

**Use the Templates:** PostClient includes built-in templates for Storage REST API definitions. These templates provide a quick start for understanding the API structure and available operations.

**Construct Your Requests:** Use the templates and shortcuts to construct your API requests. PostClient's handy shortcuts for common request parameters and headers will help you save time and reduce errors.

**Send Requests Offline:** Remember that PostClient operates entirely offline, so you can be confident that your data is secure and not stored in the cloud.

**Review Responses:** Once you send a request, review the response within PostClient. The tool will display the results, allowing you to quickly see the outcome of your API call.

**Iterate as Needed:** Make any necessary adjustments to your requests and resend them as needed. PostClient makes it easy to modify and resend requests for testing and development purposes.

**Provide Feedback:** As you use PostClient, please share your feedback and suggestions for improvement. Your input is valuable in helping us enhance the tool to better meet your needs.

By following these steps, you should be able to quickly get up to speed with interacting with Azure REST APIs using PostClient. If you have any questions or need assistance, please do not hesitate to reach out.

# Roadmap

We have an exciting roadmap of features planned for PostClient, including:

**Variable Support:** We plan to introduce a feature that allows the use of variables as part of the request definition. This will enable dynamic request construction, making it easier to manage and reuse requests with different parameters. For example, you could define a variable for the base URL and use it across multiple requests, simplifying the process of switching between different environments or endpoints.

**Working Environments:** Another upcoming feature is the ability to define working environments. This will allow users to switch between different sets of configurations, such as development, testing, and production, with ease. By defining environment-specific variables and settings, you can ensure that your requests are always sent to the correct endpoint with the appropriate parameters.

**Secure Local Collections:** We also plan to add a feature that allows users to save request collections securely and locally. These collections will be encrypted to ensure the privacy and integrity of your data. With this feature, you can organize and manage your requests in a more structured manner, enhancing productivity and collaboration within the team. You'll be able to save your work, share collections with team members, and maintain a history of requests and responses for future reference.

These features will be designed to further improve the usability and functionality of PostClient, making it an even more powerful tool for our development and customer support efforts. I look forward to your feedback and suggestions as I work towards implementing these enhancements in time.
